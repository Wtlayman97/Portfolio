            <p>My name is William "Tyler" Layman. I am an aspiring software developer from Fairmont, West Virginia.
                I am currently honing my skills in Java, JS, Python, .NET, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I have been working on some smaller
                personal projects to further display my proficiency in these languages and will be adding them to this 
                webpage as they are completed. 
            </p>
            <p>I am passionate about exercising creativity in my problem solving. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects
                and expand my knowledge in the field. 
            </p>
