            <p>Born in 1997 in Fairmont, West Virginia.</p>
            <p>I was raised in a military family and spent much of my childhood in different parts of the country.</p>
            <p>Graduated Summa Cum Laude from East Fairmont High School in 2016 with two consecutive years as an AP Scholar.</p>
            <p>With full academic scholarship to the Benjamin M. Statler College of Engineering, I initially pursued a 
                degree in chemical engineering before changing course and eventually taking a break from pursuing a my degree.</p>
            <p>After working in retail leadership and adolescent behavioral/substance abuse rehabilitation, my wife and I started
                our family. I found this to be the perfect time to begin pursuing my dream career in software development.</p>
            <p>I have taken on an expedited courseload to finish my backelors of science in just two years and am working 
                toward my career in full-stack development. Through some personal projects and pro-bono work, I am working to 
                expand my knowledge in Angular, React, Ruby, and GoLang to better complement my proficiencies in Java, Python, 
                PHP, JavaScript, and HTML.</p>
